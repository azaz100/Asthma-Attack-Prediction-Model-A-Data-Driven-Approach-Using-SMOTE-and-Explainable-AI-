![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

[cite_start]This repository contains the code and resources for the research project **"Asthma Attack Prediction Model: A Data-Driven Approach Using SMOTE and Explainable AI"**[cite: 1, 398]. [cite_start]This work was presented at the **16th International IEEE Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT) 2025**[cite: 394, 402].

[cite_start]The project focuses on developing a highly accurate machine learning model to predict asthma attacks by analyzing a combination of patient health data, demographic information, and environmental triggers[cite: 6]. [cite_start]A key innovation is the integration of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure the model's predictions are transparent and interpretable for clinical use[cite: 10, 329].

## üìñ About The Project

[cite_start]Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects millions of people worldwide, characterized by unpredictable and potentially life-threatening attacks[cite: 5]. [cite_start]Traditional methods for predicting attacks often fall short due to the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors[cite: 18].

[cite_start]This project leverages machine learning to create a robust predictive model that can provide early warnings for asthma exacerbations[cite: 22]. [cite_start]By analyzing a diverse dataset, our model identifies critical patterns and risk factors[cite: 328]. [cite_start]To move beyond "black-box" predictions, we employ **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** and **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** to make the model's reasoning transparent, building trust and facilitating its adoption in clinical decision-making[cite: 329, 216].

### Key Features ‚ú®
* [cite_start]**High-Accuracy Prediction**: The final Random Forest model achieves an accuracy of **97.58%** on the test set[cite: 9, 223].
* [cite_start]**Data-Driven Approach**: Utilizes a comprehensive dataset including patient history, demographics, and environmental data like Air Quality Index (AQI) and temperature[cite: 24, 6].
* [cite_start]**Imbalanced Data Handling**: Implements the **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** to effectively address class imbalance between attack and non-attack instances, preventing model bias[cite: 29, 140].
* [cite_start]**Intelligent Feature Selection**: A Random Forest Regressor is used to identify and select the top 10 most influential features, optimizing model performance and reducing noise[cite: 141, 150].
* [cite_start]**Dual-XAI Framework**: Integrates both SHAP for global feature importance and LIME for case-specific prediction explanations, offering a complete view of the model's behavior[cite: 216, 218].

## üîÑ Methodology Workflow

The project follows a structured methodology from data acquisition to model interpretation:

1.  [cite_start]**Data Acquisition**: The study uses the IEEE asthma dataset, which contains 584 instances and 32 features covering patient and environmental data[cite: 127, 128].
2.  [cite_start]**Data Pre-processing**: This crucial phase includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, feature scaling (normalization), and outlier detection[cite: 26, 27, 137]. [cite_start]SMOTE is applied to balance the dataset[cite: 29].
3.  [cite_start]**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visual analysis is performed to understand data distributions and feature relationships[cite: 86].
4.  [cite_start]**Feature Selection**: The top 10 most predictive features are selected using Random Forest importance scores[cite: 141]. [cite_start]Key selected features include `medication`, `chest_tig`, `pefr`, and `Temp`[cite: 152].
5.  [cite_start]**Model Training & Tuning**: Twelve different classification algorithms‚Äîincluding Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting‚Äîare trained and evaluated[cite: 31, 185]. [cite_start]`GridSearchCV` is used for hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance[cite: 32, 191].
6.  [cite_start]**Model Evaluation**: Models are rigorously assessed using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score[cite: 33, 88].
7.  [cite_start]**Model Explainability**: SHAP and LIME are applied to the best-performing model to interpret its predictions globally and locally[cite: 89].

## üß† Explainable AI (XAI) Insights

* [cite_start]**SHAP Summary Plot**: The SHAP analysis revealed that `medication`, `chest_tig` (chest tightness), and `pefr` (peak expiratory flow rate) are the most significant global predictors[cite: 315]. [cite_start]High values for `medication` and low values for `pefr` strongly influence the model's output[cite: 317].
* [cite_start]**LIME Plot**: LIME provides explanations for individual predictions[cite: 220]. [cite_start]For example, for a specific "No Asthma Attack" prediction, LIME highlighted that high medication use and low chest tightness were the primary contributing factors[cite: 319].
