![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)

This repository contains the code for the project **"Asthma Attack Prediction Model: A Data-Driven Approach Using SMOTE and Explainable AI"**.

The project focuses on developing a highly accurate machine learning model to predict asthma attacks by analyzing a combination of patient health data, demographic information, and environmental triggers. 
A key innovation is the integration of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure the model's predictions are transparent and interpretable for clinical use.

## ðŸ“– About The Project

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects millions of people worldwide, characterized by unpredictable and potentially life-threatening attacks. Traditional methods for predicting attacks often fall short due to the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.

This project leverages machine learning to create a robust predictive model that can provide early warnings for asthma exacerbations. By analyzing a diverse dataset, our model identifies critical patterns and risk factors. To move beyond "black-box" predictions, we employ **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** and **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** to make the model's reasoning transparent, building trust and facilitating its adoption in clinical decision-making.

### Key Features âœ¨
* **High-Accuracy Prediction**: The final Random Forest model achieves an accuracy of **97.58%** on the test set.
* **Data-Driven Approach**: Utilizes a comprehensive dataset including patient history, demographics, and environmental data like Air Quality Index (AQI) and temperature.
* **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Implements the **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** to effectively address class imbalance between attack and non-attack instances, preventing model bias.
* **Intelligent Feature Selection**: A Random Forest Regressor is used to identify and select the top 10 most influential features, optimizing model performance and reducing noise.
* **Dual-XAI Framework**: Integrates both SHAP for global feature importance and LIME for case-specific prediction explanations, offering a complete view of the model's behavior.

## ðŸ”„ Methodology Workflow

The project follows a structured methodology from data acquisition to model interpretation:

1.  **Data Acquisition**: The study uses the IEEE asthma dataset, which contains 584 instances and 32 features covering patient and environmental data.
2.  **Data Pre-processing**: This crucial phase includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, feature scaling (normalization), and outlier detection. SMOTE is applied to balance the dataset.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visual analysis is performed to understand data distributions and feature relationships.
4.  **Feature Selection**: The top 10 most predictive features are selected using Random Forest importance scores. Key selected features include `medication`, `chest_tig`, `pefr`, and `Temp`.
5.  **Model Training & Tuning**: Twelve different classification algorithmsâ€”including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boostingâ€”are trained and evaluated. `GridSearchCV` is used for hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
6.  **Model Evaluation**: Models are rigorously assessed using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
7.  **Model Explainability**: SHAP and LIME are applied to the best-performing model to interpret its predictions globally and locally.

## ðŸ§  Explainable AI (XAI) Insights

* **SHAP Summary Plot**: The SHAP analysis revealed that `medication`, `chest_tig` (chest tightness), and `pefr` (peak expiratory flow rate) are the most significant global predictors. High values for `medication` and low values for `pefr` strongly influence the model's output.
* **LIME Plot**: LIME provides explanations for individual predictions. For example, for a specific "No Asthma Attack" prediction, LIME highlighted that high medication use and low chest tightness were the primary contributing factors.

## ðŸ”­ Future Scope

Future research can extend this work in several exciting directions:
* **Real-time Data Integration**: Incorporate live data from wearable devices and environmental sensors to enhance predictive accuracy.
* **Longitudinal Analysis**: Integrate long-term patient data, including genetic information and medication compliance, for more personalized predictions.
* **Advanced Data Fusion**: Combine structured and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes) to create a more holistic patient profile and improve asthma care.
